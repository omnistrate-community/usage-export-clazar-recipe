# S3 to Clazar Usage Exporter

This exporter automatically pulls usage metering data from S3 and uploads aggregated data to Clazar on a monthly basis. It is designed to run as a cron job, processing usage data for the previous month and sending it to Clazar for billing purposes.

## Prerequisites

### AWS Permissions
Your AWS credentials need the following S3 permissions:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: `s3:PutObject` permission is required for storing the state file in S3.

## Deploy in Omnistrate

To deploy the Clazar Exporter in Omnistrate, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omnistrate-community/usage-export-clazar-recipe.git
   cd usage-export-clazar-recipe
   ```

2. Build the exporter into a service using the Omnistrate CLI. Ensure you have the Omnistrate CLI (`omctl`) installed and logged in. Make sure you have docker installed and running.

```bash
omctl build-from-repo --product-name "Clazar Exporter"
```

3. To run the job, create a resource instance in Omnistrate with below parameters:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key ID
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret access key
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region (default: uses AWS default)
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: S3 bucket name
- `CLAZAR_CLIENT_ID`: Clazar client ID for authentication
- `CLAZAR_CLIENT_SECRET`: Clazar client secret for authentication
- `CLAZAR_CLOUD`: Cloud provider name (e.g., "aws", "gcp", "azure")
- `SERVICE_NAME`: Name of the service (e.g., "Postgres")
- `ENVIRONMENT_TYPE`: Environment type (e.g., "PROD", "DEV")
- `PLAN_ID`: Plan ID (e.g., "pt-HJSv20iWX0")
- `STATE_FILE_PATH`: Path to state file in S3 (default: "metering_state.json")
- `START_MONTH`: Start month for processing (format: YYYY-MM, default: "2025-06")
- `DRY_RUN`: Set to "true" to run without sending data to Clazar (default: "false")
- `DIMENSION1_NAME`, `DIMENSION1_FORMULA`: First custom dimension name and formula. Refer to the [Custom Dimensions Configuration](#custom-dimensions-configuration) section for details.
- `DIMENSION2_NAME`, `DIMENSION2_FORMULA` (Optional): Second custom dimension name and formula (left empty if not needed)
- `DIMENSION3_NAME`, `DIMENSION3_FORMULA` (Optional): Third custom dimension name and formula (left empty if not needed)

## Custom Dimensions

**Example Usage:**
- `DIMENSION1_NAME`: "pod_hours"
- `DIMENSION1_FORMULA`: "cpu_core_hours / 2"

This would create a custom dimension called "pod_hours" calculated as half of the CPU core hours (assuming 2-core machines).

**Available Variables in Formulas:**
- `memory_byte_hours`: Memory usage in byte-hours
- `storage_allocated_byte_hours`: Storage usage in byte-hours
- `cpu_core_hours`: CPU core usage in core-hours

**Formula Rules:**
- Both name and formula must be provided together for each dimension
- Dimension names must be unique across all custom dimensions
- Formulas can use basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
- Formulas can use functions: abs, min, max, round, int, float
- If any formula fails to evaluate, the entire contract's data for that month will be skipped
- Formulas must evaluate to non-negative integers
- Combined dimensions can be used to create more complex calculations, such as:
  - `DIMENSION1_NAME`: "total_compute_units"
  - `DIMENSION1_FORMULA`: "cpu_core_hours + memory_byte_hours / 1024 ** 3"

**Note:** The dimension names should match your configured Clazar dimensions. Otherwise, Clazar will not recognize them. 

## Job Behavior

### Periodic Execution
The metering processor is configured to run as a cron job every 5 minutes. When the container starts, it immediately runs the script once before the cron schedule takes effect. You can also modify the cron schedule by editing the `crontab` file in the repository. If a previous run is still executing, the new cron job will be skipped to prevent overlapping executions.

### Processing Logic

- On each run, the job determines the "next month to process":
  - If there is no previous processing, it starts from **two months ago** (relative to the current date), to avoid processing the current (possibly incomplete) month.
  - If there is a last processed month, it starts from the **month after the last processed month**.
- The job processes months sequentially, up to a maximum number of months per run (default: 12).
- The job **never processes the current or future months**â€”it only processes months that are fully in the past.

### Error Handling and Retry Logic

- **Automatic retries**: When a contract fails to process for a given month (for example, due to a Clazar API error), the script automatically retries up to 5 times with exponential backoff (2^attempt seconds).
- **Error tracking**: Failed contracts and their error details are recorded in the state file under `error_contracts` for that service/month/contract.
- **Payload preservation**: The exact payload that failed is stored in the state file, so you can see the usage values and manually add them in Clazar if needed.
- **Retry on subsequent runs**: Error contracts are automatically retried on subsequent runs until they succeed or reach the maximum retry limit.
- **Per-contract processing**: Each contract is processed individually, so one failing contract doesn't block others from being processed successfully.

### Subscription Cancellation
Please note that the script does not handle subscription cancellations. If a subscription is canceled, you will need to manually upload the usage data for that contract and month to Clazar in time. Every marketplace has a grace period for submitting usage data after a subscription ends, so ensure you are aware of those deadlines.

## Tracking State

The state file stored in S3 tracks:
- Last processed month and last updated timestamp per service configuration
- List of successfully processed contracts per month per service configuration
- List of error contracts per month per service configuration

Example state file structure:
```json
{
  "Postgres:PROD:pt-HJSv20iWX0": {
    "last_processed_month": "2025-06",
    "last_updated": "2025-07-25T20:15:37Z",
    "success_contracts": {
      "2025-06": [
        "ae641bd1-edf8-4038-bfed-d2ff556c729e",
        "bf752ce2-fee9-5149-cgfe-e3gg667d83af"
      ]
    },
    "error_contracts": {
      "2025-06": [
        {
          "contract_id": "ce751fd3-ghi9-6159-dhgf-f4hh778e94bg",
          "errors": ["Some error"],
          "code": "ERROR_001",
          "message": "Error occurred",
          "retry_count": 3,
          "last_retry_time": "2025-07-25T20:15:37Z",
          "payload": {
            "request": [
              {
                "cloud": "aws",
                "contract_id": "ce751fd3-ghi9-6159-dhgf-f4hh778e94bg",
                "dimension": "pod_hours",
                "start_time": "2025-06-01T00:00:00Z",
                "end_time": "2025-06-30T23:59:59Z",
                "quantity": "360"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Checking Logs
The script provides detailed logging. Monitor the logs for:
- Any errors or warnings
- AWS authentication method being used
- State updates
- Retry attempts and backoff delays
