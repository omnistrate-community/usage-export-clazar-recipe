# S3 to Clazar Usage Export Script

This script automatically pulls usage metering data from S3 and uploads aggregated data to Clazar on a monthly basis. It maintains state in S3 to ensure no data gaps or duplicates, making it suitable for production deployment. The script tracks processed contracts per month to avoid duplicate submissions during reruns.

## Prerequisites

### AWS Permissions
Your AWS credentials need the following S3 permissions:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: `s3:PutObject` permission is required for storing the state file in S3.

## Configuration

### Customize Clazar Dimensions
This script assumes you are charging for the following dimensions and have configured them in Clazar:
- `memory_byte_hours`
- `storage_allocated_byte_hours`
- `cpu_core_hours`

If you are using different dimensions, update the script accordingly to aggregate and send the correct data.

Note the `quantity` field in the payload should always be a string of positive integers, as Clazar expects this format. So ensure your dimensions and aggregation logic align with this requirement.

## Job Behavior

### Processing Logic

- On each run, the job determines the "next month to process":
  - If there is no previous processing, it starts from **two months ago** (relative to the current date), to avoid processing the current (possibly incomplete) month.
  - If there is a last processed month, it starts from the **month after the last processed month**.
- The job processes months sequentially, up to a maximum number of months per run (default: 12).
- The job **never processes the current or future months**â€”it only processes months that are fully in the past.

### Error Handling

- When a contract fails to process for a given month (for example, due to a Clazar API error), the contract and its error details are recorded in the state file under `error_contracts` for that service/month/contract.
- You can find the usage data for these contracts in the state file and manually add usage for those contracts and months in Clazar if needed.

### Subscription Cancellation
Please note that the script does not handle subscription cancellations. If a subscription is canceled, you will need to manually upload the usage data for that contract and month to Clazar in time. Every marketplace has a grace period for submitting usage data after a subscription ends, so ensure you are aware of those deadlines.

## Run it as a Job in Omnistrate
To set up a job in Omnistrate, run the following command in your terminal. Make sure you have the Omnistrate CLI installed and configured before running the command.

```bash
omctl build-from-repo --product-name "Clazar Exporter"
```

To run the job, you can create a resource instance in Omnistrate with the necessary parameters.

## Tracking State

The state file stored in S3 tracks:
- Last processed month and last updated timestamp per service configuration
- List of successfully processed contracts per month per service configuration
- List of error contracts per month per service configuration

Example state file structure:
```json
{
  "Postgres:PROD:pt-HJSv20iWX0": {
    "last_processed_month": "2025-06",
    "last_updated": "2025-07-25T20:15:37Z",
    "success_contracts": {
      "2025-06": [
        "ae641bd1-edf8-4038-bfed-d2ff556c729e",
        "bf752ce2-fee9-5149-cgfe-e3gg667d83af"
      ]
    },
    "error_contracts": {
      "2025-06": [
        {
          "contract_id": "ce751fd3-ghi9-6159-dhgf-f4hh778e94bg",
          "errors": ["Some error"],
          "code": "ERROR_001",
          "message": "Error occurred"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Checking Logs
The script provides detailed logging. Monitor the logs for:
- Any errors or warnings
- AWS authentication method being used
- State updates

Example output:
